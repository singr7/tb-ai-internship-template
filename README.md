# 🫁 AI for Tuberculosis Detection

You will build an AI system to detect Tuberculosis from Chest X-ray images.

You will progress through:
Logistic Regression → Random Forest → CNN → Transfer Learning → Explainable AI

## 📅 Timeline

| Week | Focus |
|------|------|
| 1 | Data + Logistic Regression baseline |
| 2 | Feature-based ML |
| 3 | CNN |
| 4 | Transfer learning |
| 5 | Explainability (Grad-CAM) |
| 6 | Optional CT (MONAI) |

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

You must report:

• Sensitivity (Recall for TB)  
• Specificity  
• ROC-AUC  
• Confusion Matrix  

TB sensitivity is the most important metric.

---

## 🧪 Datasets

You must use at least one:

• TBX11K  
• Shenzhen TB  
• Montgomery County TB  

---

## 📁 Deliverables

By the end you must submit:

• Trained model  
• Grad-CAM visualizations  
• Performance table  
• Final report in `/reports/final_report.pdf`
